## Weasel War Dance
## Description
The name of my app is called "Weasel War Dance", inspired by a weasel's technique to disorient and confuse its prey through dance. The game app is designed as a mix between a "Dance Revolution" and a "Wack'em All", with the main player being the character "Weasel Mos". The goal is to catch the rabbit by correctly clicking at least 50% of the flashing colored buttons. The player will be informed automatically if his dance combo was succesful, through a win celebration illustration of the weasel catching the rabbit. If the dance failed, the rabbit will go back into his den and disappear. 

The app is split into 3 parts: 
1. Intro page - gives the player background information on the weasel war dance to help connect him to his character
2. Instruction page - the character "Weasel Mos" appears and tells the player what the game goal and instructions are
3. Game page - hosts the dance game 


## Background
It is based on the nickname I received in highschool - "Weasel Mos", that represented both my effervecent nature, as well as my undying, proposterous ambition to go after seemingly unattainable goals. Just as the weasel can catch prey 10 times bigger than itself through unconventional methods (in this case, its frantic dance), I also find ways to thrive in situations that I'm completely unequipped for.

## Getting Started

Start the game by clicking on the link below:
https://weasel-war-dance-mos.netlify.app

- If you're curious to learn more about the weasel's war dance, please enjoy the fun and educational You Tube Video found at the bottom of the page
- If you already know about the weasel's amazingness, then let's go ahead and "click to play"
- You are now on an introduction page where you get to meet Weasel Mos, that tells you what the goal is and how to reach it
- Wait for the speech bubble to vanish, so that you can move onto the game page
- Now that you are on the game page, you can get started by clicking the "start" button, which will launch the flashing buttons
- Try to catch as many buttons as you can!
- If you get enough buttons, you catch the rabbit 
- If you didn't get enough buttons, the rabbit runs away and you can start again


## MVP Goals/Stretch Goals/Whatâ€™s Next
- I reached my MVP Goals 
- I want to integrate a win celebration through an illustration of the weasel catching the rabbit
- I also want to have a lose celebration through an illustration/ animation of the rabbit running away
- Currently I have alerts set up for win/ lose but I will replace those
- I want to add more speech bubbles at the instruction page that will break down the text content
- I also want to have more interaction between the rabbit and the weasel 
- I would like to improve the graphics overall
- Regarding the code, I want to rewrite it all using mainly classes (which is what I started to do and I commented it out at the end)

The Google fonts I used were meant to give the impression of cartoon comics and the lotti animations have been a helpful addition.
