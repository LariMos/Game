## Weasel War Dance
## Description
The name of my app is called "Weasel War Dance", inspired by a weasel's technique to disorient and confuse its prey through dance. The game app is designed as a mix between a "Dance Revolution" and a "Wack'em All", with the main player being the character "Weasel Mos". The goal is to catch the rabbit by correctly clicking at least 50% of the flashing colored buttons. The player will be informed automatically if his dance combo was succesful, through a win celebration illustration of the weasel catching the rabbit. If the dance failed, the rabbit will go back into his den and disappear. 

The app is split into 3 parts: 
1. Intro page - gives the player background information on the weasel war dance to help connect him to his character
2. Instruction page - the character "Weasel Mos" appears and tells the player what the game goal and instructions are
3. Game page - hosts the dance game 


## Background
It is based on my nickname in highschool "Weasel Mos", that represented both my energetic nature, as well as my undying proposterous ambition to go after goals that seem impossible to achieve.

## MVP Goals/Stretch Goals/What’s Next
- I reached my MVP Goals but do not have the questions inside of the other 3 categories; however, the functionality is there.
- I would like to continue to flesh out the questions/answers of the other categories and by possibly adding images from the films and sound effects from the films.
- I would also like to provide another animation at the end to celebrate the winner or coax the loser to play again.
## References
Aside from using the above, I also found some great fonts that capture the films.
