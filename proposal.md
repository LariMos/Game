- [ ] Weasel War Dance

## Project Description 

The name of my app is called "Weasel War Dance", inspired by a weasel's technique to disorient and confuse its prey through dance. The game app is designed as an online dance revolution, where the main player must succesfully complete 3 dance combos in order to win. Initializing the first dance combo will bring the rabbit out of its hidding spot. With each succesful dance combo completed, the rabbit moves closer to the weasel. When the final dance combo is complete, the rabbit arrives in its final position, and the weasel moves intot he same spot, catching the rabbit, and marking the end of the game. The player will be informed automatically if each dance combo was succesful though a speech bubble. If the dance failed, the rabbit will move 3 steps back. If all combos were successful, the player has the option to go again, by restarting the game.
